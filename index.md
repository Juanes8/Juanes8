# Hi everyone! 

Welcome to my Github, where you can find a little bit from my work. 

## About me 

I am a Mechanical and Electrical Engineer ⚙ from [Tec de Monterrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterrey_Institute_of_Technology_and_Higher_Education) and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science 🧑🏽‍💻 at [ITAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_Aut%C3%B3nomo_de_M%C3%A9xico).  

Before I started my path as a Data Scientist, I worked in the USA as a Field Service Engineer at [SEAM GROUP](https://www.seamgroup.com/), 
performing infrared thermal inspections on live electrical connections, I learned to focus on the tiny details to prevent failures. 
I also worked for two years as a Service Sales Engineer at [Grundfos](https://www.grundfos.com/es), selling predictive maintenance contracts 
and other service solutions in the Central and SouthEast area of Mexico. During this experience, I learned to identify and solve customers' needs by having
effective communication, increasing 30% of active contracts in 2020.

- 🌱 I am currently learning about Deep Learning and Bayesian Statistics.
